<h1>Fully-Differential Folded-Cascode OpAmp (IBM 0.18&mu;m CMR7SF) </h1>

<p>
A fully-differential folded-cascode operational amplifier was designed with IBM 0.18&mu;m 7RF
process. The amplifier has 85.3dB differential gain, cut-off frequency equal to 2.2MHz and
differential output signal excursion greatear than 1V, operating with an 1.8V power supply.
For more details refer to the <a href="opamp.pdf">technical report</a>.
This design was sent to fabrication and will be tested soon.
