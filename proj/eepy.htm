<h1>Equations in Python for Electronic Circuits Hand-Design</h1>

<p>
Every now and then, when I find any useful equation, I write it down in Python code to reuse later. These equations can be solved easily, for any variable, using the scipy module and they useful specially for electronics hand-design (not complete hand-design, since you are automating some steps using this piece of software).
</p>

<p>
All equations and how to solve them are described in the documentation on "doc" directory. The equations are divided in modules. The following modules are provided:

<b>eepy.mosfet.py</b> - An all region mosfet model </br>
</p>

<p>
This is a work in progress. Any feedback is appreciated.
